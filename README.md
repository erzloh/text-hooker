# Text Hooker

A simple web application that allows you to quickly view and edit text from your clipboard.

I built this tool for my personal Japanese study. It helps me quickly select words from my clipboard and open a pop-up dictionary Chrome extension (e.g., Yomichan).

## Features

*   **Clipboard Access:** Automatically reads and displays the content of your clipboard when you visit the page.
*   **Refresh:** A "Refresh" button to manually fetch the latest clipboard content.
*   **Edit:** An "Edit" button that lets you modify the displayed text in a text area.

**Note:** Your browser will ask for permission to read your clipboard. You need to grant this permission for the application to work correctly.
